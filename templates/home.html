                    Hello! I'm Britni and I'm a junior at Cornell University. I'm an aspiring software engineer, and I discovered my love of programming over four years ago in high school. Now, I'm working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, with a minor in Spanish. On campus, I have three part-time jobs involving campus recreation and education. I'm also involved in Cornell Tradition, an organization dedicated to service and work. I grew up in Queens, New York, with my parents and sister. I have a dog and several fish. In my free time, I enjoy working out, going fishing, cooking, baking, and spending time in nature.
